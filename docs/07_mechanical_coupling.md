## Mechanical Coupling (Piezoelectric & Piezoresistive Effects) ðŸ”Š
Mechanical stress and vibration can couple directly with a circuit's electrical behaviour.

Piezoelectric Effect: This is a two-way street. Applying mechanical stress to certain materials (like quartz crystals or specific ceramics) generates a voltage. Conversely, applying a voltage to these materials causes them to physically deform. This is the principle behind quartz oscillators, which act as the heartbeat for virtually every digital circuit, from watches to computers. It's also used in sensors like microphones and accelerometers.

Piezoresistive Effect: In this case, the electrical resistance of a material changes when it's mechanically strained. This is a primary mechanism used in modern pressure sensors and strain gauges. If a circuit board is bent or vibrating, the resistance of its components can change slightly, altering the circuit's behaviour.
