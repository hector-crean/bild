## Acoustic Coupling ðŸŽ¶
Acoustic waves (sound) are a form of mechanical vibration and can interact with circuits, primarily through microphonic effects.

Microphonics: This is where mechanical vibrations, including strong sound waves, cause components within a circuit to vibrate. This vibration can induce small, unwanted voltage fluctuations, essentially acting like a microphone. This is a well-known issue in high-gain audio amplifiers and other sensitive analog circuits, where certain capacitors or vacuum tubes can be particularly susceptible to picking up acoustic noise.
