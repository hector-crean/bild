You've hit on a crucial point that separates simple schematic simulation from real-world device analysis. You're exactly right: a schematic diagram is a topological abstraction. It doesn't contain any information about the physical layout, yet that layout is critical for thermal effects.

When components heat each other up, it creates a **feedback loop** that can significantly alter a circuit's behaviour. To model this, you need to go beyond a simple electrical simulation and perform an **electro-thermal co-simulation**.

### ## The Two Sides of the Problem

The coupling between electrical and thermal domains is a two-way street.

#### 1. Electrical to Thermal (Heating)
Every component that dissipates power acts as a heat source. For a resistor, this is described by Joule's first law:

$$P = I^2R$$

In your simulation, after solving the electrical system for the currents ($I$) and voltages, you can calculate the power dissipation ($P$) for every component. This power becomes the heat input for a subsequent thermal simulation.

#### 2. Thermal to Electrical (Feedback)
As a component's temperature ($T$) changes, its electrical properties change. The most common example is a resistor's temperature coefficient ($\alpha$). Its resistance at a given temperature is no longer constant:

$$R(T) = R_0 [1 + \alpha(T - T_0)]$$

Where $R_0$ is the resistance at a reference temperature $T_0$. For semiconductors like diodes and transistors, the effects are even more complex and non-linear, affecting forward voltages, leakage currents, and gain.

### ## How to Model the Physical Layout

To account for components heating each other, you must model heat transfer through the physical space of the circuit board. There are two main approaches.

#### Approach 1: Compact Thermal Models (CTMs)
This is the more pragmatic approach and is very elegant. You create a second, *equivalent thermal circuit* that represents the physical layout.

In this thermal circuit:
* **Voltage** is analogous to **Temperature ($T$)**.
* **Current** is analogous to **Heat Flow ($P$)**.
* **Resistance** is analogous to **Thermal Resistance ($\theta$)**.

You would create a thermal network where each component is a node. The heat sources are the power dissipation values ($P$) calculated from the electrical simulation. The connections between nodes are **thermal resistances** that represent how easily heat flows between them.
* $\theta_{ij}$ would be the thermal resistance between component $i$ and component $j$ through the circuit board (conduction).
* $\theta_{ja}$ would be the thermal resistance from component $j$ to the surrounding air (convection).

Solving this thermal network gives you the temperature at each component node.

#### Approach 2: Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
This is the high-fidelity, industry-standard method used by tools like Ansys or COMSOL. It requires building a full 2D or 3D geometric model of your circuit board and its components.

The software then divides this geometry into a fine mesh and numerically solves the heat equation, which governs heat conduction, convection, and radiation across the entire physical space. This is computationally very expensive but provides extremely accurate temperature distribution maps.

### ## The Co-Simulation Loop

In practice, you would solve the two systems iteratively, passing information back and forth at each time step:

1.  **Initialize**: Set initial temperatures for all components (e.g., ambient temperature).
2.  **Electrical Solve**: Using the current component parameters (like $R(T)$), run your MNA electrical simulation for a small time step, $\Delta t$.
3.  **Calculate Power**: From the electrical solution, calculate the power dissipation ($P = I^2R$) for each component.
4.  **Thermal Solve**: Use these power values as heat inputs into your thermal model (either the CTM or FEA). Solve the thermal model to find the new temperature of each component.
5.  **Update Parameters**: Update the electrical properties of each component (e.g., $R(T)$) based on its new temperature.
6.  **Loop**: Go back to step 2 for the next time step.

This loop correctly models the feedback where a component gets hot, its resistance changes, which changes the current, which in turn changes its heat output for the next time step.
